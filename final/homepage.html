          <div id="maintitle"> The Vine Alignments </div> 
          <p>
            Vine, an app founded in June 2012 by Dom Hofmann, Rus Yusupov, and Colin Kroll. The feed consisted of 6 second long videos. Divided by a personalized feed, a trending page, themes, and a browsing page. Throughout Vine’s short-lived life was many popular creators, both good and bad, some might say evil. Through Vine, we saw the rise of shitty creators like Logan Paul and Lele Pons. I will not mention good creators as that’s subjective. Who I think is good may not be who you think is.

On January 20th, 2017, all Vine videos were archived and the app was no more. There was talk of a second app but this was put on hold due to legal and financial hurdles. So now, we’re left with long compilations of Vines that litter youtube and phrases spoken between friends who shared the app.

Anyways, that’s enough history of Vine. What I’m looking to do is organize some of these iconic 6-second videos into the Alignment System. This consists of lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil. Many have sorted what they think represents these categories into video form and discussed over the internet. This is my take, for my enjoyment and hopefully a laugh or two from the reader.

            First, we must discuss what the alignment chart is/its origins. In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, alignment is a categorization of the ethical and moral perspective of player characters, non-player characters, and creatures. Most versions of the game feature a system in which players make two choices for characters. Using this, I will begin to categorize popular and non-popular vines to fit.
