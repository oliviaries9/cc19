	Sit down and cry for a bit, realizing you should have listened to that guy.

		The overwhelming feeling of being lost takes over, and you fall back to the ground, sobbing in a panic. Why didn’t you listen to the creepy gross clerk at the gas station? Haven’t you seen enough horror crap to know to NOT be THAT person? 15 minutes of your crying passes and you manage to calm yourself down, only to soon hear the crunching of the grass beneath feet coming from what is assumably around the corner. You cover your mouth as your heart begins to pry at your chest. This seems like a common theme for today. There’s only one option here for you to do, you must prepare yourself to physically fight whatever is about to turn the corner. Pulling yourself to your feet and whipping away any tears, you make yourself as big as you possibly can. The footsteps grow closer and keep sounding heavier and heavier. Your hands become fists and fight or flight starts kicking in. You break into a sprint down the green path, hollering at the top of your lungs, trying to scare whatever it is that might be coming to get you. As you turn the corner, arms flailing, voice booming, you almost run straight into another person who looks just as panicked as you. Do You
