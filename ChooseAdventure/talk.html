	Calm down and try to talk to him
</div></h1>
	<p>
		Both of you are screaming now but not moving. Just staring at each other and screaming. It takes a moment but you both calm down and you end up sharing a laugh. After introducing yourself and explaining your situation, he mentions his name is “Lemon.” Strange name, but you’re not one to question. He explains that he stumbled upon the maze a day or two ago after making a wrong turn in the woods. He had decided to try and run from the birdmen, just as you did, but ended up getting whacked. You can tell he’s starting to get dehydrated. “We should keep walking.” You point down the path, feeling a little better now that you’re not completely alone.  Lemon follows, a bit slow. You’re walking and striking up interesting conversation. Your personal lives, past, present, and future. Lemon eventually tells you why he’s named after a fruit. Apparently his parents we’re crazy and named all their children after fruit. His older sister’s name is Raspberry and younger brother’s name is Guava. Eventually the sun begins to set and darkness falls upon the maze. Lemon and you find a nice place to sit down for the night. You’re exhausted as you lean against the shrubbery. “If you wake up first would you mind waking me? I think it’s best we start walking again as soon as we wake in the daylight.” Lemon doesn’t say much. He’s staring at you with a creepy glint in his eyes but he nods in agreement. You feel as if you might not be able to trust him after all. But your eyelids are so heavy you can’t worry about him. Suddenly a sharp pain is stabbing at your stomach and you wake up screaming. Lemon is holding you down and stabbing over and over again into your gut. He’s speaking in Latin at a high pitch, eyes rolled back into his head. He eventually stops and sprints away into the darkness.You got stabbed to death by a possessed guy and failed to make it out ):
