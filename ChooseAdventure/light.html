		You saunter down the bright path, smiling. The creators of this maze are definitely pulling a Princess Bride reverse psychology stunt. But your cocky attitude is quickly shut down. You reach another fork in the road and turn left, only to reach a dead end within two turns. You turn back and head down the right path but reach another dead end. Defeated and WRONG you turn back and decide to take the dark path. You make it back to the circle, sigh and turn towards your only other option.
