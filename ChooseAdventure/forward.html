		“This is just a minor fork in the road.” You say to yourself, and immediately start down the path. Making turns left and right, left and right, over and over again. Unaware of how lost and far you are from the exit, you continue on. Eventually, the sun starts to set and you shake your head out of a trance like state. You were walking all day, zoned out with a blank mind. There seems to be something in the air down this path that has made you start to lose your mind. With what little sense of clarity you have left, you turn around and start to walk back to hopefully the fork in the road.The next time you shake yourself out of the trance, it’s daylight again. You walked all night and have no clue where you are in the maze. You continue on, quickly falling back into a trance like state. Another day passes and you’re unable to shake the trance. You end up walking until you collapse and die from exhaustion.
		You Died ):
