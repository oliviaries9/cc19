		You break the awkward eye contact with the birdman and begin to walk back to your car but only make it a few steps before heavy feet come behind you. It’s the birdman, and he’s getting increasingly faster. Breaking into a sprint you try to shake the birdman. He’s gaining on you faster than your feet can carry you. With one quick WACK of his quarterstaff, he knocks you out and your body hits the ground with a thud. 
	Shooting up in a panic, all you can see around you is green. The walls of the maze loom overhead and your heart drops to your toes. Immediately, you look around for your backpack but to no avail, it’s gone. Luckily, your phone is still in your pocket and you pull it out to check the time. It’s 2:30. You were out for too long, the original plan was to be back home by 4 but that seems impossible. Turning in all directions, you realize you’re at a dead end. 
	You have two choices 
</p>
<ul> 
	<a href="./forward.html" > Walk forward and try to find a way out </a>
<br>
	<a href="./sitdown.html" > Sit down and cry for a bit, realizing you should have listened to that guy. </a>
</ul>
