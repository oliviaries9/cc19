			You hesitate but end up turning left, after all, it’s your lucky direction. You end up walking for about 20 minutes when you reach a circle. It’s the middle of the maze and you managed to find it. There’s a fountain in the middle that’s dried up and a few bird sitting on top. A few pieces of a broken bench are scattered around. Past the circle is another fork in the road. Through one is never ending darkness and the other is filled with lights lining the floors. Which route do you dare take?
