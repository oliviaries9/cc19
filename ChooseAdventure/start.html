	The Grass Maze 
</div></h1>
 		<p>
 		After leaving the crowded life of a bustling city, you found yourself living in a rural area with trees and forests everywhere. Once settled in after a few days of unpacking, you decided to explore the neighborhood and find a quaint coffee shop. While in a coffee shop, you overhear two locals talking about a grass maze out in a clearing in the middle of the woods. Apparently no one has made it out and came back to tell. It was after that day you became obsessed and it occupied every thought. One night, you found yourself tossing and turning in bed. Sleep wasn’t coming that night so you began to pack a small backpack with the idea of trying to find the maze in the morning. Packed and ready, sleep pulls your eyelids down into bed. 
 		The early morning arrives and you set off in your car on a drive through the many rural roads that you have yet to explore. 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes pass, it’s only 9:45 am so you’re not worried about daylight disappearing. With every road sign, you slow down to read. “Campsite 15 minutes” or “deer crossing during season” but no “maze ahead!” sign. You’re starting to give up hope as 10:30 comes and goes. You realize you need gas and quickly find a station. “CASH ONLY” in big bold letters covers all the card readers so you make your way inside. It’s a pretty typical gas station, and you decide to get some snacks while you’re at it. 
 		“$20 on 4 please.” The cashier nods and begins to ring you up. “Say… you wouldn’t know anything about some kind of grass maze out in these here woods, do you?” you curiously poke the cashier for any new information on the location. 
 		He stops ringing up the snacks and turns towards you. “Whaddaya wanna know?” His breath reeks of chewing tobacco and his voice is tuned to that of a sarcastic asshole. 
 		“I-uh I’m just trying to find it and document it. I’m a photographer.” You’re not, but you don’t want to tell this stranger that you’ve been obsessing with something possibly fake. 
 		“Alright, imma tell you this and ain’t repeat it so you best write it down somewhere. Also, you owes $27.35” He sticks out his hand signaling to be paid and you rummage in your pocket for money, also bringing out your phone to take note of whatever he says. “You gonna wanna make a right outta this station and continue for bout 20 minutes or so. It’s a hidden path on the right side o the road. Turn there and jus keeps goin straight. You’ll reach a hill. Park your car there and walk up the hill. You’ll sees it from there.” He hands you the change and grabs onto your hand, pulling you closer over the counter. “But you ain’t gonna make it back if you go in, so jus stays on that hill and look from there. Don even walk near it.” He glared into your eyes letting go and ushering you out of the store with the flick of his hand. 
 		Your car sputters as you turn the key. You head back out on the road, turning right and feeling the eyes of the cashier clerk watching from the dirty convenience window. It’s 11:30 now and your eyes keep flicking back to the clock and to the right side of the road with “20 minutes” in mind. 
 		
 		11:49. Your eyes are basically locked to the right of the road. All you could think about was missing the turn. 
 	 
 		11:50. A growing feeling of anticipation bites at your fingertips. You can’t take your eyes off the right side and slow down to a walking speed. No one else is on the road so who cares about the speed limits. 

		11:55. That hopeless feeling is coming back. Even if you made a u-turn, you could just be making u-turns until sun-down with no luck. 

		12:05. You slam on the breaks as fast as possible and your seatbelt chokes you back. There it is, the hidden turn covered by leaning trees. A lump forms in your throat and you repeat the clerk's words “I won’t make it back if I go in.” Surely he meant the maze itself and not just the road. Taking your foot off the brake, you turn the wheel to the right and slowly make your way into the path, heading straight. 

		12:15. The guy might have lied about the time it took to get there but you found the hill. Your heart feels like it’s about to burst out of your chest as you turn off the car and sling your backpack over one shoulder. Taking one look at your phone, 0 bars. Rolling your eyes you sigh “This is starting to feel like some shitty horror film” and you tuck it away in a jacket pocket. 

		The lump in your throat is gone but your legs feel like they’re about to collapse underneath you as you hike up the hill. The sun is now beaming down harshly but the changing winds of fall keep a cool breeze. 

		There it is. The maze you have been obsessing over for days. An urge to get closer takes over and your feet lead you down the hill in a daze, mouth agape. Two large figures are standing by what is assumably the entrance. With the body of a buff man and what seemed to be the large head of a hawk, the birdmen stood tall with giant quarterstaffs. As you get closer, you lock eyes with one of them and can’t avoid its piercing gaze.
