	Beat the ever-loving sh*t out of this guy and take what he has in his pockets to hopefully escape 
</div></h1>
	<p>
		You start throwing punches left and right, getting good hits at this man. He isn’t fighting back, probably out of fear and utter shock from you screaming as you turned the corner. He falls to the floor and you throw one last punch to his face. Presumably knocking him out but not killing him. His chest is still moving up and down as you dig his pockets. You find nothing. You have nothing. You’re alone. And you’ll stay alone. You’d rather not wait for the man you just beat up to wake up. Adrenaline still rushing, you break off towards the right. 6 pm has arrived and the sunsets. Your phone has died, you’re extremely thirsty as your feet help you wander the maze in a daze. You’re more lost than you know it. “Leave the city, they said. You’ll find peace, they said” You mumble angrily to yourself remembering what your parents told you after you decided to move away. The sun eventually leaves. It’s starting to get colder out at night and you find another dead end to sleep in the corner, head only now starting to throb from being hit by the buff birdman.The next morning shakes you awake as the sun hits your eyelids. Your lips are chapped, mouth dry and you feel slightly psychotic. “Maybe I’m Bear Grylls and this is some kind of test” you mumble, shielding your eyes from the sun. Today feels much hotter than yesterday. With Bear Grylls in mind, you take your jacket and wrap it around your head to shield from the sun. Then set off on a day of walking and winding through the maze. With every turn, your hope crumbles and sanity begins to diminish. Another fork, dead end, right turn, left turn. Seemingly no end in sight. The sun sets and after a few hours of stumbling in the dark, you fall to the ground and pass out.  Unfortunately, after 2 days of being stuck in the maze with no food and no water, you lose your mind completely. Spending your final 24 hours trying to dig a way out, causing your fingertips to bleed. You try to burst through the thick shrubbery but end up with scratches lining your arms. You start screaming “HELP” to hopefully be heard but only lose your voice.Alas, nothing you do works, and you find yourself back in the same dead-end you woke up in at the start. You know this from the body indent in the corner, which you fall back into and close your eyes for one last time.
