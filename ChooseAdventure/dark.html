	Dark Path
</div></h1>
	<p>
	You shrug and veer towards the path of darkness. In your head you think “often times people will make things seem creepy so you don’t choose em, but I’ll play the reverse-psychology card and take the path.” Besides, you packed a flashlight for this occasion. Before stepping into the darkness you reach for the flashlight in your backpack and shine it down the path. It’s just a normal path and you start making your way through it. Wondering, you glance at your phone to check the time. Only 1:30 and you seem to be making great progress, of course you have no clue where you actually are. After a few minutes, the lights begin to line the floor and the sky seems to open back up over the path, it’s no longer dark. Your feet are starting to feel the burning effect of walking and you decide to take a little sit down break. Checking the time again, somehow an hour passed. You sigh and laugh “Why did I do this. I’m never gonna find my way out. I’ve been walking down this straight path for an hour but it only felt like 10 minutes.” Leaning your back against the shrubbery, you take another sigh, take a sip of water and get back up. The most important thing right now is to keep your sanity, so you begin trailing down the path. Eventually you come to a left turn. There’s no other choice but to take it. You travel on, ignoring the time passing and occasionally munching on one of the several granola bars you packed. Another turn, this time right. It’s starting to get tedious and you begin to wonder if you should backtrack your way to the start and leave that way. But you’ve taken so many turns and already spent long enough. There’s no way you’d make it out before sundown. The time now is 4:00. Clouds have moved in and created a dreary mood. You want to lay down in bed and forget this happened but you’re stuck in a fricken maze. Ignoring the increasing pain around your body, your phone suddenly starts to vibrate. You answer to hear an automated message from some solicitar and angrily hangup… but wait… “Signal???!!!” You must be close to the exit. The pain you were previously feeling is replaced by a rush of adrenaline. You’d like to start sprinting down every path but what if this is just a small area with signal? It can’t be, this has to be close to the end. The sound of birds chirping has returned to your ears which left the soundscape the minute you stepped into the maze. There’s no suppressing the excitement, and you bolt forward breaking into the fastest runner’s sprint of your life, making turns at greyhound speed. You bump into a few shrubbery walls, receiving some gnarly scratches but it doesn’t matter. You see what you think is the exit and speed up. You’re laughing maniacally and screaming all together as you run past the arch of the exit and straight into another open field. Freedom. You plop down on your back in the middle of the grass, breathing the heaviest you ever have. You made it out, just as the sun is really starting to set. You’ll deal with finding your car after you catch your breath. It’s 7 now and you’re having a victory drive in your car. Windows down, music blasting, you’re on top of the world and <h2>made it out of the maze.</h2>
