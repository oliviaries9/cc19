        1. 50 State Blue Print 
      </h3>

          The USA has the largest number of incarcerated peoples in the world. With a flawed justice system and power-hungry cops, it’s an unfortunate reality. But this website can bring it into perspective and educate others on what can be done. Design-wise, I really like the choice of blue and gold/yellow color together. It’s easy on the eyes. As for the function, the scrolling and revealing new information is interactive and can catch readers' eyes quickly. Making them want to continue scrolling and reading.  I enjoy the simplicity that comes with the fonts chosen and how there aren’t too many things to click on. If there were, it could distract from the real purpose of the website. It’s interesting how they also chose to separate more and more information into states, and how quick and simple it is to find it, allowing it to be easy to use to educate/inform.

      2. NYC Tree Map
    </h3>
        <p>
          When I think of NYC, my brain immediately reminds me of the horrid smells that are accompanied by trash littering the sidewalks. I tend to forget that trees are actually planted in the city but now I honestly can’t stop looking at the trees near the places I tend to congregate. The Map itself is very easy to navigate and it’s clear how they sectioned it. The colors are very easy to follow, even though it’s all just shades of green. The only part I find to be a bit clunky is the sidebar that pops up when you click on a tree, as it takes up almost half the map space. Also, there are 111 trees in Laguardia Airport? I honestly think this is the most efficient way of documentation as well as a good example of making information accessible to the public.

          I truly like the idea of this website. It’s fun and interactive. But the biggest flaw has to be legibility. I understand it’s part of the design and was created at a different time but I found it very difficult to read and find the text. I’d love to see an updated version of this from 2019, integrated with the music and maybe an extension of the map. It’s a fun way to explore the city without having to leave my bed! It almost reminds me of some kind of online Zine. The format is sporadic and I found myself clicking in circles and ending up starting over to try and find a new area of the city.
