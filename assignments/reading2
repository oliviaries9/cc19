   		Communication will always be advancing and developing as long as the earth isnâ€™t up in flames or underwater. Even if it was underwater, a new species of humans with gills would probably develop some form of communication method. While literacy and reading/writing has not always been around, communication has. Cave people drew on cave walls to communicate some kind of message or meaning. Slaves that lacked the ability to read and write still had needs of communication. When developing new methods for limited means of communication, accessibility sticks out as one of the main disadvantages.
