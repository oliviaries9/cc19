	<h1> 
		Reading 4
	</h1>
	<ul>
		1. How boxes work and how much goes into them. Thinking about margins, padding, borders, width, and other elements on the page.
	<br>
		2.Normal Flow also known as Block Flow Layout - how you shouldn’t go against it. It helps content stay in flow and doesn’t allow it to overlap. 
	</br>
	<br>
		3. I’ve heard the terms “in flow” and “out of flow” but never understood them until reading the article. How “in flow” refers to elements that are given space and respected by other elements. “Out of Flow” is taking an element and placing in in a space that no longer is respected by the other items in the flow. These terms are helpful in understanding how elements should be around a page. 
	</br>
	<br>
		4. I wasn’t aware of the layout systems that have been put into use that seem to make CSS easier. I had this idea that everything was built completely from the ground up. 
	<br>
		5. Animations and how complicated they can be. They seem to fall under different programs and file names
	</br>
</ul>
	<h3>
		Three Questions
	</h3>
		<li>
			Obviously, technology is always advancing but what are some outlooks on the future for systems like grid and flexbox? 
			<li>
			How to differentiate between which languages to use for animations/transformations? 
			<li>
			How long would it take to really learn ALL of this stuff and master it?
